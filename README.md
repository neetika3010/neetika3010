## Welcome to my GitHub!

I'm a **Data Scientist** with a passion for solving real-world problems using Statistics,Core Machine Learning,Deep Learning,NLP and GenAI. My work spans **regression analysis**, **unsupervised clustering**, **Generative AI and LLM-powered systems**, and **deep learning architectures**, applied to real-world challenges in **public health**, **election strategy**, **MSME development**, and **government policy analytics**.

Currently building robust, reproducible AI workflows using **PyTorch**, **LangChain**, **Docker**, and **AWS** — with a focus on modularity, deployment, and impact.


### Blog and Learning Resources

I regularly write on **Data Science,NLP,Core Machine Learning,GenerativeAI** — turning complex topics into intuitive explainers.  
**Check out my blog on [Medium](https://medium.com/@neetikashree)** for articles on AI evaluation, RAG, and more!


### Languages and Tools

`python` `pytorch` `scikit_learn` `huggingface`  
`docker` `aws` `langchain` `openai` `flask` `streamlit`  
`pandas` `numpy` `matplotlib` `seaborn` `sql`
